3.  Write a Python program to check a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.  
Note :
An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.

Expected Output:
Input lengths of the triangle sides:                                    
x: 12                                                                    
y: 12                                                                    
z: 12                                                                   
Equilateral  triangle 

4. Write a function stats() that takes one input argument: the name of a text file.
The function should print, on the screen, the number of lines, words, and characters in the file; your function should open the file only once. 
>>> stats('example.txt') File: example.txt line count: 3 word count: 20 character count: 98


5. Create a Python program that includes an array holding elements
               [37, 2, 6,4,90,45,67,21]
And sort all the array elements in ascending order.

6.  Implement a program that requests four numbers (integer or floating-point) from the user. 
Your program should compute the average of the first three numbers and compare the average to the fourth number. 
If they are equal, your program should print 'Equal' on the screen. 
>>> Enter first number: 4.5 Enter second number: 3 Enter third number: 3 Enter last number: 3.5 Equal

7.Write a programme that calculates the final bonus of an employee. 
The bonus is calculated by  multiplying the number of years that employee has worked for the company by 50% of their monthly pay.
If the user has worked over 10 years, then for each year after the 10th year,the Employee gets 2500 added to the final bonus.   

8. Write a Python program to count the number of strings
where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last character are same from a given list of strings.
      
9.  Write a Python function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.

10.Take an alphabet as an input from the user and display the next alphabet.
If the user enters a special charachter,The programme should display that the charachter entered is a special charachter.
